# AI Usage Report

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)

## How AI Helped
I used ChatGPT to:
- Explain the assignment requirements in simple language.
- Propose a feature set that satisfies the advanced functionality, API integration, and state management requirements.
- Generate initial versions of:
  - `index.html`
  - `css/styles.css`
  - `js/script.js`
  - `docs/technical-documentation.md`
  - `README.md`

## My Edits and Review
- I reviewed the generated code to understand each section (API calls, event listeners, validation, localStorage usage).
- I can change the GitHub username in the API URL to my own.
- I can customize the styles to match my personal portfolio theme.

## What I Learned
- How to use `fetch()` to call the GitHub REST API and handle JSON responses.
- How to store and read data from `localStorage` for theme and user name.
- How to add basic client-side form validation using JavaScript.
- How to structure a small front-end project with HTML, CSS, JS, and documentation files.
