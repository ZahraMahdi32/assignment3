# Assignment 3 – Portfolio with Advanced Functionality

This project is a small portfolio-style webpage created to satisfy the requirements of **Assignment 3 – Advanced Functionality**.

## Features

- **API Integration**
  - Uses the public GitHub REST API to fetch and display the latest repositories from a user (default: `octocat`).

- **Advanced Logic**
  - Sorting of repositories by creation date (`Newest` / `Oldest`).
  - Basic filtering buttons (e.g., `All`, `School`, `Personal`) as a starting point for more advanced filters.
  - Client-side form validation for the contact form (email and message).

- **State Management**
  - Theme preference (`light` / `dark`) stored in `localStorage`.
  - User name stored in `localStorage` and shown in the greeting.

- **Documentation**
  - `docs/technical-documentation.md` explains the technical design.
  - `docs/ai-usage-report.md` documents AI assistance.
